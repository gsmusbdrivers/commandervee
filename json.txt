The agreement covers AgriStability Program Years 2018-2022. Any Program Year ending in 2018, before or after April 1, will be processed under the CAP rules. For example, if you have a February 28, 2018 fiscal year-end your claim will be processed under CAP rules.<br><br>The CAP agreement includes four changes to AgriStability:<br><strong>1. <em>Adjusted Reference Margin Limit</em></strong>: Reference Margins subject to limiting are now guaranteed at least 70% of their calculated Olympic Reference margin. <br><strong>2. <em>Simplified Participation:</em></strong> Reduced information requirements for both the issuance of fees and the calculation of reference margins.<br><strong>3. <em>Minimum Benefit Calculation</em></strong>: Benefits must calculate to $250 or greater to be received by Participants.<br><strong>4. <em>Late Participation:</em></strong> A provision in the agreement which allows for extending the deadlines for participation. Late Participation may only be enacted when a significant portion of the province has experienced an agricultural disaster. </p><p><strong><span style=\"COLOR: #006400\">What is the Adjusted Reference Margin Limit?</span></strong><br>Under Growing Forward 2, the Reference Margin used to calculate Program benefits was the lower of the Olympic Average and the average adjusted expenses, known as the Reference Margin Limit. <br>Under CAP, the Reference Margin Limit will now be adjusted to ensure a more equitable level of support for Participants impacted by the limit. Participants subject to limiting are now guaranteed at least 70% of their calculated Olympic Average Reference Margin, known as the <strong>Adjusted Reference Margin Limit.</strong> </p><p><strong><span style=\"COLOR: #006400\">What is Simplified Participation?</span></strong><br>1. Simplified enrolment for issuance of fees: if there is not enough information in AFSC records to calculate a fee, your fee will be calculated using industry benchmark information based on your estimated Program Year productive units.</p><p>2. Reduced information requirements for calculating a benefit: new participants or participants who have been out of the Program for at least 4 years prior to the Program Year can choose to supply 3 years of tax and supplementary information rather than 5 years. If they choose to submit only 3 years, their reference margin will be the average of the last three years rather than the 5-year Olympic Average.</p><p><strong><span style=\"COLOR: #006400\">What does minimum payment mean?</span></strong><br>A minimum payment of $250 was introduced for the Program Years 2018-2022. Essentially, if a producer's benefit calculates to less than $250, it will not be paid to the producer. <br><br><strong>Example:</strong><br><em>Version 1 of a benefit calculates to $150. No benefit is paid.<br><br>Version 2 is processed and the benefit amount is now $300. $300 is paid to the participant. <br><br>Version 3 is processed and the new benefit amount is $350. An additional $50 is paid to the producer. <strong>Note that the net benefit on version 3 is less than $250 but the gross benefit is greater than $250.</strong></em></p><p><strong><span style=\"COLOR: #006400\">How does \"Late Participation\" affect me?</span></strong><br>Late participation will only be offered in Program Years that have experienced a significant agricultural disaster and whereby both the federal and provincial governments have agreed jointly to extend the deadline for participation. This provision will include a 20 per cent penalty on any benefits.<br><br>Late participation provisions will be effective for the 2018-2022 Program Years (CAP Agreement).</p><p><strong><span style=\"COLOR: #006400\">How does the AgriStability Program work?<br></span></strong></p><li>AgriStability targets assistance to farm operations facing large margin declines caused by production loss, increased costs, or market conditions.<br></li><li>AgriStability calculates a production margin (current year) and a reference margin (Olympic average of your five most recent production margins). If your production margin falls below your payment trigger (70 percent of your reference margin), AgriStability will pay you 70 percent of the difference.<br></li><li>Your production and reference margin are unique for your operation as they are built using your income tax and supplementary information. AgriStability benefits are paid after your tax year is complete and you have submitted your tax and AgriStability supplementary forms. <br></li><li>AgriStability is a low cost program. The cost works out to an approximate fee of $315 for every $100,000 of your reference margin. <br><br><strong><span style=\"COLOR: #006400\">Why would I participate in AgriStability if I already carry AgriInsurance?</span></strong><br>AgriStability is a whole farm program that covers all commodities produced on your farm whereas AgriInsurance provides coverage on a crop by crop basis, and offers spot loss coverage for specific perils.<br><br>Although both programs cover production loss, AgriStability also covers other risks such as rising input costs, price volatility and commodity loss due to fire or spoilage. <br><br>AgriStability, when combined with AgriInsurance, can help manage your overall risk. <p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong><span style=\"COLOR: #006400\">How do I participate?</span></strong><br>If you have not participated in AgriStability before or are wishing to rejoin the program, either complete the AgriStability Application for Fee Notice or provide a written request indicating your intent to participate by April 30 of the Program Year in which you wish to participate. <br><br>Pay the fee. The fee is approximately $315 per $100,000 of your reference margin. There is a minimum Enrolment Fee of $45 and an Administrative Cost Share fee of $55. Fees must be paid by April 30 to avoid a 20% penalty. Fees can be paid up to December 31 of the Program Year with penalty. <br><br>File your income taxes by the deadlines established by CRA.<br><br>Submit your application forms. Participants must submit completed Supplementary forms by the established deadlines. The deadline is September 30 of the following calendar year. Supplementary forms will be accepted until December 31, subject to a penalty. </p><p><strong><span style=\"COLOR: #006400\">What happens now that I have applied?</span></strong><br>AFSC receives a high volume of claims in the month of September. Participants are encouraged to file their information early.<br><br>As all applications are subject to review, you may be contacted for additional information. Upon completion of processing, participants will receive a Calculation of Program Benefits (COPB). You will have 18 months from the date on the COPB to request adjustments to your information.<br><br>Participants facing a financial crisis may contact AFSC to have their file prioritized; however, they will be required to outline their circumstances in writing via email, fax, or mail.</p><p><strong><span style=\"COLOR: #006400\">My farming operation has changed; how will this affect my AgriStability application?</span></strong><br><em><strong>Changing what I produce</strong></em><br>If you change commodities, expand or downsize your operation, AgriStability will adjust your reference margins to reflect your current operation. This is referred to as \"structural change\".<br><br><em><strong>Changing my legal structure</strong></em><br>If you change the legal structure by incorporating, your fee, reference margins and production history will be transferred to the corporation. Corporations must submit Financial Statements, T2 Schedule 1 and an accrual to tax. Beginning in 2018, corporations must submit the tax information using the Alberta Statement A for Corporations/Co-operatives/Other Entities. <br><br><strong><em>Changing circumstances due to death of a participant</em></strong><br>The executor/beneficiary is responsible to ensure the estate meets AgriStability deadlines and requirements. <br>To help explain the steps that need to be followed when handling estate issues for AgriStability claims, refer to Technical Information Circular (TIC) #2 - Estates and Deceased Individuals. It can be found on <a href=\"/Default.aspx?cid=3743-3746-3860\">AFSC's website</a>.</p><p><strong><span style=\"COLOR: #006400\">What do I need to do if I no longer want to participate in the AgriStability Program?</span></strong><br>If you no longer want to participate, you may opt out of the Program by providing written notice to AFSC. Written notice must be received by the enrolment notice deadline, April 30 of the Program Year you wish to opt out or 30 days after the issuance of your enrolment/fee notice. <br><br>By opting out, you will be ineligible for benefits in the Program Year in which the opt out occurs. <br><br>If you do not opt out by the deadline, your fees will still be owing and payable. </p><p><strong><span style=\"COLOR: #006400\">If I opt out of AgriStability, am I still eligible to participate in AgriInvest?</span></strong><br>Yes. <br><br>Individuals who file their taxes on a T1163 Statement A will have their information sent to the AgriInvest Administration directly from CRA. <br><br>Corporations that participate in the AgriInvest Program should continue to submit their tax information to AFSC by the deadline of September 30. Beginning in 2018, corporations must submit their tax information on the Alberta Statement A for Corporations/Co-operatives/Other Entities. Clearly identify \"AgriInvest only\" on the first page. </p><p><strong><span style=\"COLOR: #006400\">If I opt out, when can I get back in?</span></strong><br>You can get back in by sending an Application for Fee Notice or a written request to enroll by April 30th of the Program Year in which you wish to participate. <br><br><strong><span style=\"COLOR: #006400\">Why am I being charged a fee when I did not participate last year?</span></strong><br>Once enrolled you are considered to be participating until we receive an opt out request form. If you did not \"opt out\" of the program, your fees are still owed even though you may not have participated in the program. You will be sent a new enrolment/fee notice for the current year because you have not opted out of the program. </p><p><strong><span style=\"COLOR: #006400\">What is myAFSC? </span></strong><br><a href=\"/Default.aspx?cid=3748\">myAFSC</a> is an online portal that participants and their authorized representatives can use to submit supplementary form information. <br><br>If you are having problems with <a href=\"/Default.aspx?cid=3748\">myAFSC</a> or you would like a copy of your pre-populated forms, you can contact the Client Contact Centre at 1.877.899.2372.</p><p><strong><span style=\"COLOR: #006400\">Where can I find additional information?</span></strong><br>Call Contact Centre at 1.877.899.2372.

What if I decide to do something other than combine my crop?</span></strong><br><strong>A</strong>. If you decide to do something other than combining (pasture, bale, etc.), contact your branch office to arrange a yield assessment on these acres. AFSC On Farm Inspectors will release the acres put to another use. </p><p><strong><span style=\"COLOR: #006400\">Q. Will AFSC write off my crop if I don't get it harvested?</span></strong><br><strong>A. </strong>AFSC provides a production guarantee and is required to account for the total production of the crop, taking into consideration yield, grade, weight and dockage. From AFSC's past experience, many snowed-under crops are harvested in the spring and most of these crops can be sold or used as feed. AFSC does recognize some of these crops may be severely discounted in the marketplace; this will be taken into account when these claims are finalized.</p><p><strong><span style=\"COLOR: #006400\">Q. My crop has started to sprout in the swath. How will AFSC assess it?</span></strong><br><strong>A.</strong> AFSC will only consider viable crop to determine yield. Sprouted and moldy kernels are not included in determining the yield count for the unharvested crop. Harvested grain will be graded according to the Canadian Grain Commission standards. </p><p><strong><span style=\"COLOR: #006400\">Q. My standing canola suffered frost damage and will potentially be graded as 'sample'. Is quality taken into consideration?</span></strong><br><strong>A.</strong> The designated grade for canola is 1 CAN. Grade factors for every crop are determined each year based on the value of the grade of the grain compared to the designated grade and applied to the harvested production. This will reduce the yield in determining the final indemnity payment.</p><p><strong><span style=\"COLOR: #006400\">Q. What happens in the spring with my unharvested acres? </span></strong><br><strong>A. </strong>If you decide to do something other than combining (pasture, bale, etc.), contact your local branch office to arrange a yield assessment on these acres. AFSC On Farm Inspectors will release the acres put to another use. Spring harvested production should be kept separate from fall harvested production.</p><p><strong><span style=\"COLOR: #006400\">Q. What happens in the spring with my unharvested crop?</span></strong><br><strong>A. </strong>Damage and quality loss will be accounted for once the final yields are determined after harvest is completed.</p><p><strong><span style=\"COLOR: #006400\">Q. I have a wildlife inspection this fall. What happens in the spring if there is more damage</span></strong>?<br><strong>A.</strong> Where an extension of insurance coverage is provided, wildlife damage will also be honored.
